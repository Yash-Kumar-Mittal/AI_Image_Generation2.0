**AI Image Generation with DALL-E API and MERN Stack**

AI image generation is an exciting and rapidly evolving field within artificial intelligence. Recent advancements in machine learning algorithms, especially in generative models, have significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI. With the advent of deep learning techniques, researchers have developed robust AI models capable of generating images that closely resemble real ones. These AI-generated images have a wide range of potential applications, including in entertainment, design, and advertising.

This project draws inspiration from one such powerful AI image generation model: OpenAI's DALL-E.

The application is a full-stack web platform developed using the MERN stack. It enables users to create AI-generated images using OpenAI's DALL-E API based on their text inputs. The application is distinguished by its modern and minimal design, dynamic layouts, hover effects, and community-sharing features.

**Features added:**
- Modern and minimal interface for easy navigation.
- "Surprise me!" button.
- Search functionality.
- Ability to download generated images.
- Hover effects that display the user's prompt along with their username and a download button.
- Sharing functionality to share AI-generated images within the community section.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Client:** HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, React
- **Server:** NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Cloudinary
- **API:** OpenAI's DALL-E
